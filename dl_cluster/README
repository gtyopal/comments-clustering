1. First run "dl_train.py" to train seq2seq model to generate seq2seq vector,
and concatenate with word2vec and tfidf-lsi vectors to generate final vectors for clustering.
2. Then run "dl_clustering.py" to do clustering by using minibatchkmeans/hdbscan/agglomerative, which can be set by dl_setting.py/cluster_type.
3. Get final clustering result files of kmeans_cluster_tags.csv/dbscan_cluster_tags.csv as the labeled training dataset for next classification step.
4. Plot the three plots in one screen by running "cluster_result_plot.py
5. Get the clustering result file with represented label words in each cluster by running "compute_clusterid2name".
